# Description

### Objective:

The goal of this project is to create a predictive machine learning model using Python and scikit-learn. This model should be able to **classify or predict outcomes** from a dataset, such as identifying spam emails, predicting disease, or classifying customer sentiment.

## Dataset:

This project uses a dataset suitable for binary/multiclass classification. Examples:

* Spam vs Ham Email Dataset
* Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset
* Iris Flower Classification Dataset
* Sentiment Analysis Dataset

The dataset is split into:

* **Features (X)** — The input variables
* **Labels (y)** — The target or outcome to predict

---

## Workflow:

### 1. Data Collection:

* Load dataset using `pandas`
* Explore dataset (shape, null values, class distribution)

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

* Handle missing values
* Encode categorical data if any
* Normalize or scale features
* Split dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20)

### 3. Model Selection:

* Choose a model based on the problem type:

  * Logistic Regression
  * Decision Tree
  * Random Forest
  * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  * Naive Bayes
  * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### 4. Training:

* Train model using `model.fit(X_train, y_train)`
* Evaluate training accuracy

### 5. Testing and Evaluation:

* Predict with `model.predict(X_test)`
* Evaluate with:

  * Accuracy
  * Confusion Matrix
  * Precision, Recall, F1-score
  * ROC-AUC (if applicable)

### 6. Visualization:

* Confusion Matrix Plot
* Feature Importance (if applicable)
* ROC Curve

## Sample Code Snippet:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Load and preprocess dataset
data = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')
X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
y = data['target']

# Split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

---

## Deliverables:

* A complete **Jupyter Notebook** (`.ipynb`) with:

  * Clean and documented code
  * Proper headings for each section
  * Output of evaluation metrics and visualizations
* Dataset used (`dataset.csv`)
* `requirements.txt` with all libraries used
* README.md (this file)

---

## How to Run:

1. Clone or download the project folder
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook model.ipynb
```

4. Run all cells sequentially

---

## Tips:

* Use Stratified Split if dataset is imbalanced
* Tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV
* Use cross-validation for better generalization
* Save your model using `joblib` or `pickle` for reuse

---

## Optional Enhancements:

* Create a web UI using Streamlit or Flask
* Add model interpretability with SHAP or LIME
* Deploy the model using platforms like Heroku or Render

---

## Conclusion:

This project is a practical implementation of end-to-end machine learning workflow using real-world datasets. It covers:

* Data cleaning
* Model training
* Evaluation
* Visualization
* Reporting
